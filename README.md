# Music Visualiser Project

# Description of the assignment
It has been over a year since the pandemic hit the whole world and here we are still living our lives, wasting our youth. Even though it has been such a   devastating experience, as a Korean poet Sang-wha Lee said, Spring comes to the lost land. This assignment represents the eagerness for the joy that we used to appreciate and the hope that we soon will be able to reunite with it. Since I am a huge music fan who barely turns off the music, I wanted to create an art piece which reacts to the music, so the quality of my life can be increased while I'm listening to the tunes. My all time favourite character is Elmo so he was chosen as a main actor of the program. He starts dancing with his 2 friends and as the song is being close to the hook, mini elmos are created and they all vibe together.


# Instructions
This project is consist of 4 classes which are Main, JinasVisual, Star and  Monster. Through the main class, the other three classes start executing and sharing the visualisation.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
